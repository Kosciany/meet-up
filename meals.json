(you can chop the almonds and apples in a food processor, but the peel must be done by hand.) grate three quarters of the nutmeg (sounds a lot but it's correct).\r\n\r\nmix the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light muscovado sugar, eggs and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl. \r\n\r\nholding the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything together. repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 mins – the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. ask the family to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish. \r\n\r\ngenerously butter two 1.2 litre bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each. pack in the pudding mixture. cover with a double layer of baking parchment, pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in place with a rubber band while tying). trim off any excess paper. \r\n\r\nnow stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top, then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight). tie with more string, and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. watch our video to see how to tie up a pudding correctly.\r\n\r\nboil or oven steam the puddings for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary. remove from the pans and leave to cool overnight. when cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new baking parchment, foil and string. store in a cool, dry place until christmas. \r\n\r\nto make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar. gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. put in a small bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. the butter will keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks. \r\n\r\non christmas day, boil or oven steam for 1 hr. unwrap and turn out. to flame, warm 3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it.",

  "strInstructions": "stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling water over. leave for about 30 mins until cool and well-soaked, then mash a bit with a fork. stir in the vanilla extract. butter and flour seven mini pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. heat oven to 180c/fan 160c/gas 4.\r\nwhile the dates are soaking, make the puddings. mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate bowl. beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few mins until slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between additions. beat in the black treacle then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. repeat until all the flour and milk is used. stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. the mix may look a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. spoon it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.\r\nmeanwhile, put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream. bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely dissolved. stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 mins until it is a rich toffee colour, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. take the pan off the heat and beat in the rest of the cream.\r\nremove the puddings from the oven. leave in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins with a small palette knife before turning them out. you can serve them now with the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two coated in the sauce. to do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof serving dishes. sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of the sauce over them. cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t smudge (no need to chill).\r\nwhen ready to serve, heat oven to 180c/fan 160c/gas 4. warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 mins or until the sauce is bubbling. serve them on their own, or with cream or custard.",

  "strInstructions": "heat the oven to 300 degrees.\r\ndredging the shanks: pour the flour into a shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. one at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. discard the remaining flour.\r\nbrowning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. when the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another, do this in batches. brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. if the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside.\r\nthe aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. when the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel. season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two.\r\nthe braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.\r\nthe braise: place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.\r\nthe gremolata: while the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.)\r\nthe finish: when the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.\r\nusing a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. the shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. but if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t suffer at all. arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.\r\nfinishing the sauce: set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. if it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. taste again for salt and pepper. if the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.\r\nportioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. if the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.\r\nserving: arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce – the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.",

(if you own a heat diffuser, it would be good to use it here.) after 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. leave to cool.\r\nthe duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you can follow the next step if you like them crisp. if you are preparing ahead, pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. cover and leave in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. the liquid you are left with makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nto reheat and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220c/fan 200c/gas 7. remove the legs from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan. roast for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. serve with the reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes.",

  "strInstructions": "wash and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl. remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. i tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job.\r\n\r\nhave your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). the goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in.\r\n\r\ntime to start the soup. place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. as it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.\r\n\r\nit’s now time to add the potato (and yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nnow is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape.\r\n\r\nadd them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil.\r\n\r\nyou’ll notice that i didn’t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. however you can taste and adjust accordingly. lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.\r\n\r\nwhile this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the caribbean, latin america and africa. a hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). you can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.",

  "strInstructions": "heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.\r\ncook the sausages first. add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. after the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. if you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nsnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nfor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\r\nfor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. gently turn over and season again. cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\r\nfor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\r\nfor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. if the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. for a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\r\nfor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nonce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.",

  "strInstructions": "make the mac and cheese\r\n\r\n1. bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the package directions. the pasta should be tender but still chewy.\r\n2. while the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\r\n3. drain the pasta in a colander. place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat and add the butter. when the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. watch carefully so it does not scorch on the bottom of the pan.\r\n4. slowly whisk the milk and cream into the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. remove from the heat. gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted into the sauce. then stir in the drained cooked pasta.\r\n5. line a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter. pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly with a spatula. coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of the mac and cheese. refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\nmake the grilled cheese\r\n6. heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.\r\n7. in a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter and garlic powder until well blended.\r\n8. remove the mac and cheese from the refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. carefully cut into 8 equal pieces. each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (you can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.)\r\n9. spread 3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. place half of the slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. top each with one slice of cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (transfer from the baking sheet by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then flipping it over onto a sandwich.) place 1 slice of jack on top of each. finish with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.\r\n10. using a wide spatula, place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. cover and cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. turn and cook until the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is heated through, about 4 minutes more.\r\n11. repeat with the remaining ingredients. cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve.",

  "strInstructions": "heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits, and brush sparingly with light olive oil.\r\ncook the sausages first. add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. after the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. if you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nsnip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nfor the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\r\nfor the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. gently turn over and season again. cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.\r\nfor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.\r\nfor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. if the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. for a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.\r\nfor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. cook to your preferred stage, season and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nonce all the ingredients are cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of tomato ketchup or brown sauce.",

  "strInstructions": "rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. pat dry with a kitchen napkin. apply some oil all over and\r\nkeep it for roasting on an open flame. you can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. but then you won't get\r\nthe smoky flavor of the baingan. keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes on the flame, so that its evenly\r\ncooked. you could also embed some garlic cloves in the baingan and then roast it.\r\n2. roast the aubergine till its completely cooked and tender. with a knife check the doneness. the knife should slid\r\neasily in aubergines without any resistance. remove the baingan and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools\r\ndown.\r\n3. you can also do the dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. this is an optional step.\r\nuse natural charcoal for this method. heat a small piece of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.\r\n4. make small cuts on the baingan with a knife. place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where the roasted\r\naubergine is kept. add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. the charcoal would begin to smoke.\r\n5. as soon as smoke begins to release from the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. allow the\r\ncharcoal smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. the more you do, the more smoky the baingan bharta will\r\nbecome. i just keep for a minute. alternatively, you can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is\r\ncooked, just like the way we do for dal tadka.\r\n6. peel the skin from the roasted and smoked eggplant.\r\n7. chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it.\r\n8. in a kadai or pan, heat oil. then add finely chopped onions and garlic.\r\n9. saute the onions till translucent. don't brown them.\r\n10. add chopped green chilies and saute for a minute.\r\n11. add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well.\r\n12. bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture.\r\n13. now add the red chili powder. stir and mix well.\r\n14. add the chopped cooked baingan.\r\n15. stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the onion­tomato masala mixture.\r\n16. season with salt. stir and saute for some more 4 to 5 minutes more.\r\n17. finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta or garnish it with them. serve baingan bharta with\r\nphulkas, rotis or chapatis. it goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera rice.",

(you can add less lemon if you would prefer less citrus taste.) if the mixture looks runny, add a few more breadcrumbs.\r\npour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the surface.\r\nremove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips, 1cm/½in wide. make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\negg wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nonce the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nbake on the pre-heated baking tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, and then reduce the oven temperature to 180c/350f/gas 4. if at this stage the lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil.\r\nbake for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set.\r\nremove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin. serve warm or cold.",

  "strInstructions": "core the pears, then peel as neatly as possible and halve. if you like, they can be prepared up to a day ahead and kept in the fridge, uncovered, so that they dry out.\r\ntip the sugar, butter, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon into an ovenproof frying pan, about 20cm wide, and place over a high heat until bubbling. shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour.\r\nlay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10-12 mins, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. splash in the brandy and let it flambé, then set the pears aside.\r\nheat oven to 200c/fan 180c/gas 6. roll the pastry out to the thickness of a £1 coin. using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out.\r\nwhen the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around.\r\ndrape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see gordon’s guide). pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15 mins. if a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). reduce oven to 180c/fan 160c/gas 4 and bake for 15 mins more until the pastry is golden. leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish.",

  "strArea": "american",
  "strInstructions": "1 prepare the brisket for cooking: on one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. if there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\r\nusing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. slice through the fat, not the beef. repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\r\nsalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\r\n \r\n2 sear the brisket: you'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\r\npat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (if the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. you want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\r\nturn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\r\n\r\n3 sauté the onions and garlic: when the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. there should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.\r\nadd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. sprinkle a little salt on the onions. sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.\r\n \r\n4 return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: preheat the oven to 300°f. use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\r\nmove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.\r\ncover the pot, place the pot in the 300°f oven and cook for 3 hours. carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\r\n \r\n5 add carrots, continue to cook: after 3 hours, add the carrots. cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\r\n6 remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: when the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. cover it with foil. pull out and discard the herbs.\r\n7 make sauce (optional): at this point you have two options. you can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. if you serve as is, skip this step.\r\nto make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée until smooth. if you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. put into a small pot and keep warm.\r\n8 slice the meat across the grain: notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. this is the \"grain\" of the meat. slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.\r\nserve with the onions, carrots and gravy. serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.",

  "strInstructions": "heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.\r\nin the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture. this enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through.\r\npour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour.\r\nheat oven to 150c/fan 130c/gas 2. make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. then cook for 3 hrs. if the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.\r\nto make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. season well with salt and pepper. stir in the rosemary, thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins.\r\nafter 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.",

  "strInstructions": "pie crust:  in a food processor, place the flour, salt, and sugar and process until combined. add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse\r\n\r\nmeal (about 15 seconds). pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. if necessary, add more water. do not process more than 30 seconds.\r\nturn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. this will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. \r\n\r\nafter the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (to prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling. \r\n\r\nremove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nmake the strawberry rhubarb filling: place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. in a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. \r\n\r\nremove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.\r\n\r\nremove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees f (205 degrees c) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)\r\n\r\nplace the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.\r\n\r\nremove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. serve at room temperature with softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. reheat before serving. this pie can be frozen.\r\n\r\nmakes one 9 inch (23 cm) pie.",
